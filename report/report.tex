\section{Abstract}

The Mental Poker application created provides a decentralised method of poker hand distribution over the internet for a 7-card Texas Holdem game. The application makes use of RSA encryption and signing of individual cards to prevent cheating, and is able to abort a game if any cheating is detected.\\
					
All communication is directed through a scalable publish/subscribe server which acts somewhat like a proxy passing messages from user to user. All of the underlying communication, cryptography and game decision making components are performed in a background thread, and the results are displayed on screen. All functionality relating to game joining and hosting is also visualised on the GUI.\\
					
While the application is quite effective at what it does, there remain a couple of vulnerabilities which are inherent in the design choices made during its construction. They are outlined in Section \ref{sec:securityConcerns} in detail.

\section {Purpose}

The Mental Poker algorithm is an algorithm which allows poker cards to be dealt without a centralized third party. It allows each player to ensure that every other player is not cheating, which is incredibly necessary in internet play. \\

The intent of the Mental Poker application was to provide a safe and reliable way of dealing hands over the internet, without having to rely on a central server for any gameplay elements. All elements barring the cryptography and communications subsystems mostly follow the description of the system described in the week 3 lecture notes relating to Mental Poker. However, the communications system utilises a central scalable Elvin server.

\section{Implementation}

The Mental Poker application consists of X lines of Java code, all of which are available at \url{https://github.com/BennyEvans/CardEncryption}. The application utilises multi-threading through Swingworkers, the Swing GUI framework, the UQ-designed Elvin notification subsystem and a fairly large amount of homespun encryption code.\\

The implementation uses multiple encryption and decryption steps to assure security. As an example, if two players wanted to play a game of Poker they would need some way of securely shuffling the deck. If they don’t wish to rely on a third party then the Mental Poker algorithm could be used. This is how the dealing of cards would be done:\\

Player one first encrypts and shuffles the deck. Player one then sends the shuffled and encrypted deck to player two who also encrypts and shuffles the deck. Player two then sends the doubly shuffled and encrypted deck back to player one. At this point everyone has shuffled and encrypted the deck and player one and two have no clue as to which card is which. Player one then chooses two random cards for themselves and two random cards for player two and sends player twos’ cards  to player two. Player one and player two then both encrypt their encrypted hands again with different keys. They then both ask each other to decrypt their doubly encrypted hands. After this, player one and player two are both left with their encrypted hands that are encrypted twice by themselves with different keys (the reason for this is explained in Sections \ref{sec:encryption} and \ref{sec:validation}). After decrypting their own cards, each player has securely received their hand.

\subsection{Communications Subsystem}
\label{sec:comsubsys}				

Elvin is utilised for all inter-player communication. Elvin is a high-performance, scalable publish/subscribe system. Elvin was chosen because it was thought to be the best of both a centralised and decentralised poker system. By using a centralised communications server, additional security for players is added as players are not directly connected to each other, nor do they know one another's IP or location. Players only rely on a third party (the Elvin server) for message passing. The Elvin server has no input on gameplay so players can be assured they are not being scammed by a biased third party card dealer. The other advantage of using a central communications server is that logging can occur at the server and cheaters or rogue users can be denied service. This can be done by IP and can effectively block the cheater from all games that are being played using that communications server.\\

The implementation utilises the UQ Elvin server, and transmits pre-encrypted text strings and binary representing cards for each user, along with game information and hosting information. Hosts simply enter a loop sending out notifications every few sections that they have a game available. Players wishing to join listen for these messages and receive a list of available hosts to join. When they choose to join, they are put into a lobby where they wait until all slots are filled. The host is able to watch while slots are filled up in their GUI.

\subsection{Encryption}
\label{sec:encryption}

\end{figure}

Encryption is performed using commutative RSA. The aim of commutative RSA is to allow encryption and decryption to happen in an arbitrary order and thus letting users decrypt cards in a different order than they were encrypted. Commutative RSA is the key to Mental Poker. The implementation utilises the BouncyCastle Cryptography library to aid in encryption and decryption.\\

Commutative RSA works by sharing common p and q primes. From this n and $\phi$ can be calculated. The encryption key is randomly generated and needs to be relatively prime to $\phi$ and smaller than $\phi$. In the application implementation, the encryption key e is chosen as a prime number so if $\phi$ mod( e ) is not equal to zero then e is relatively prime to $\phi$.  The decryption key d is then calculated as the modular inverse of e, ie. find d where $ed = 1 mod ( \phi)$. In commutative RSA both e and d are kept private.\\

private void genKeys() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException,
			InvalidKeySpecException {
		BigInteger tmp;
		BigInteger testRes;
		while (true) {
 			/* Generate a prime and make sure it is coprime to on */
			tmp = genPrime(KEY_SIZE);
			/* on = (p-1) * (q-1). Computed in a different function */
			testRes = on.divideAndRemainder(tmp)[1];
			if (testRes.compareTo(BigInteger.ZERO) != 0) {
				e = tmp;
				d = e.modInverse(on);
				return;
			}
		}
	}
\end{lstlisting}
\label{fig:code}
\end{figure}

Each user encrypts their hand twice for added protection against the replay of cards in further decryption stages. Their hand is encrypted with their original encryption key used to encrypt the deck, and once receiving their hand, this hand is encrypted again with another purely private (no one can request to decrypt against this key) encryption key with the same p and q as the first. The reason behind this will be further discussed in section \ref{sec:validation} when dealing with the community cards decryption round.

\subsection{Validation}
\label{sec:validation}

Validation is used in the implementation of anti-cheating measures. There are two forms of validation used in the implementation of Mental Poker.

\subsubsection{Card Validation}

Card validation is performed in two places in the implementation. Validating the community cards is the first of this type of validation. Validating the community cards is performed using the following algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item The game host chooses 5 random cards (not in play) from the fully encrypted deck (encrypted with every game users’ key).
\item The game host broadcasts these 5 cards for everyone to receive.
\item Every player in the game then asks every other player to decrypt the community cards (in order). Explained further below.
\item Once everyone has decrypted the cards, the game host broadcasts their version of the plaintext community cards.
\item Each user then compares their decrypted versions of the community cards with the game hosts’ plaintext version. If any user disagrees they call cheat and the game is closed.
\end{itemize}

The community card decryption round also has some added protection to prevent against a rogue user asking another user to decrypt that users own hand without them knowing. The implementation provides a secure method to prevent this from happening.This is done by comparing decryption requests. In the case of a two player game each user simply compares a decryption request with the original fully encrypted community cards. In the case of a game with more than two players it becomes more complex. The way the implementation deals with this problem is by comparing the decryption requests of users who haven't been the recipient of a decryption round (are yet to decrypt cards).\\

The easiest way to explain this is with an example. Figure \ref{fig:com} shows an example of the community cards decryption rounds in a four player game. In the first round, users 1, 2 and 3 all ask the host (user 4) to decrypt the community cards. User 4 then compares the decryption requests of users 1, 2, 3 and the encrypted community cards they have. If any of the requests differ from one another, cheat is called and the game is ended. In the second round, users 1, 2 and 4 ask user 3 to decrypt the community cards. User 3 then compares the requests of user 1 and 2 with their version of the encrypted community cards. Again, if they differ, cheat is called and the game is ended. User 3 doesn't compare user 4’s request because user 4 has already been the recipient of a decryption round and it is therefore expected that user 4’s request will be different (it will have user 4’s encryption still on it because each user will decrypt their own encryption as the last step). In the third round users 1, 3 and 4 all ask user 2 to decrypt the community cards. In this round, user 2 only compares their version of the encrypted community cards with user 1’s request as user 3 and user 4 have already been the recipient of a decryption round. In the final decryption round, users 2, 3 and 4 ask user 1 to decrypt the community cards. User 1 does not compare any of the cards because users 2, 3 and 4 have been the recipient of a decryption round. After this, each user decrypts the community cards with their own decryption key which reveals the plaintext community cards.\\

After all this, every users’ decryption request has been compared with another user at least once with the exception of user 4.This means that it’s impossible for users 1, 2 or 3 to replay back a victims original cards (from the dealing of the hands stage) to learn the cards of another user. The only way this could be done is if an attacker were to ask every other user to decrypt the original encrypted hand sent to the victim, which is exactly what this validation step is designed to prevent. Furthermore, an attacker cannot replay back the final stage of decryption from the hand decryption round as the victims’ hand is doubly encrypted with a purely private key. As for user 4 (the host), naturally they cannot cheat because they are the host and are expected to broadcast the plaintext community cards once everyone has finished decrypting. If they don’t do so, or broadcast the wrong cards, everyone will call cheat and the game will be terminated.

\begin{figure}[h]

Bold represents that the user has been or is the recipient of a decryption round.\\

\label{fig:com}
\end{figure}

The validation of a winners hand is the second form of card validation. This is important because otherwise there is nothing to prevent a user from saying they have pocket aces when infact they have 7 of clubs, 2 of spades. The method to this validation is straightforward:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item At the end of a game, each user broadcasts their plaintext hand, their fully encrypted hand and their decryption key.
\item Each user determines the winner using the plaintext hands.
\item Once a winner has been chosen, the hand is checked by taking the fully encrypted hand and decrypting it with everyones decryption key to reveal the plaintext hand of the fully encrypted hand.
\item If the decrypted hand matches the plaintext hand then the user is telling the truth and are infact the winner. If the hands don’t match, cheat is called and the game is aborted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Signatures}

Because the application implementation uses publish/subscribe communication it’s possible for anyone to listen to any message. It’s also possible for anyone to spoof another user's message with great ease as users have no idea where (no IP) messages are coming from. Users also have no idea who sent a message as users don’t have a direct connection between one another.\\

Because of this, signatures need to be introduced to stop the spoofing of messages during a game. Signature validation assures a message sent from a user is actually from that user. When a user joins a game they broadcast their id, username, public key and the game they wish to join. The game host then stores this information. Unless there is a man in the middle between the user joining and the Elvin server this cannot be spoofed as Elvin in FIFO and the host will already have the original message before a rogue user could attempt to modify the public key or other data. Once a game is full, the host sends out a list of users in the game with their username, id and public key. Every message hereafter is digitally signed and every user validates every message they receive. If a signature fails verification a cheater notification is broadcasted to all users and is also replayed by the game host (if the game host isn't the one who found the validation failure in the first place). If a user receives a cheater notification at anytime they immediately leave the game.

\subsection{GUI}

\subsection {Inter-thread communication}

The application utilises a communication of string worker string communication and ArrayBlockingQueues in order to transfer objects of different types to the UI.

\subsection{Card Evaluation}

We are utilising the poker engine written by Sam Pullara to perform card evaluation. While card evaluation is not within the scope of the assessment, we believed that it would be a good feature to include. With this engine, we are able to determine the winner of the game, based on the card hands dealt to each player. This information is then displayed on the GUI.
