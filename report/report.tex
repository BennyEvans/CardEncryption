\section{Abstract}

The Mental Poker application provides a decentralised method of poker hand distribution over the internet for a 7-card Texas Holdem game. The application makes use of RSA encryption and signing of individual cards to prevent cheating, and is able to abort a game if any cheating is detected.\\

All gameplay is performed in a background thread, and the results are displayed on screen. All functionality relating to game joining and hosting is also visualised on the GUI.\\

While the application is quite effective at what it does, there remain a couple of vulnerabilities which are inherent in the design choices made during its construction. They are outlined in section \ref{sec:securityConcerns} in detail.

\section {Purpose}

The intent of the mental poker application was to provide a safe and reliable way of dealing hands over the internet, without having to rely on a central server. While this paradigm isn't entirely met (the communications system utilises a central Elvin server), all elements barring the communications subsystem follow the description of such a system on the "Mental Poker" wikipedia page.
